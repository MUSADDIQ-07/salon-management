How It Works Securely
Instead of Direct API Integration:
Application generates files locally in your browser

You download the files to your computer

You manually upload to GitHub (completely secure)

No API keys exposed - maintains full security

Smart Backup Workflow:
Add/edit subscribers as normal (data saves locally)

Application reminds you when backup is needed

One-click export generates all necessary files

Follow built-in instructions to upload to GitHub

Your data stays synchronized without security risks

Step-by-Step GitHub Upload Process
The application provides:

Export Button → Downloads multiple formatted files

Clear Instructions → Shows exactly how to upload to GitHub

Git Commands → For users comfortable with command line

File Organization → Proper structure for GitHub repositories

Example Upload Process:

bash
# Files the app generates for you:
subscribers.json          # Complete database
SALON_DATA.md            # Formatted report  
subscribers.csv          # Spreadsheet format
STATISTICS.md           # Analytics report

# Upload to GitHub:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"  
3. Drag and drop the exported files
4. Add commit message: "Update salon data - [date]"
5. Click "Commit changes"
Benefits of This Approach

Deployment Instructions

Start using enhanced backup features immediately

This solution gives you the convenience of GitHub integration while maintaining complete security. Your subscriber data will be safely backed up to GitHub without any security risks from exposed API tokens.

The application will remind you to backup regularly and makes the process as simple as possible - just a few clicks to export and upload to GitHub!
